| Erin                                      | A generic fifth participant, but rarely used, as "E" is usually reserved for Eve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Eve or Yves                               | An eavesdropper, who is usually a passive attacker. While they can listen in on messages between Alice and Bob, they cannot modify them. In quantum cryptography, Eve may also represent the environment.[clarification needed]                                                                                             |
| Faythe                                    | A trusted advisor, courier or intermediary. Faythe is used infrequently, and is associated with faith and faithfulness. Faythe may be a repository of key service or courier of shared secrets.[citation needed]                                                                                                            |

| Grace                                     | A government representative. For example, Grace may try to force Alice or Bob to implement backdoors in their protocols. Grace may also deliberately weaken standards.[16]                                                                                                                                                  |
| Heidi                                     | A mischievous designer for cryptographic standards, but rarely used.[17]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ivan                                      | An issuer, mentioned first by Ian Grigg in the context of Ricardian contracts.[18]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Judy                                      | A judge who may be called upon to resolve a potential dispute between participants. See Judge Judy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Malloryor (less commonly) Mallet or Darth | A malicious attacker. Associated with Trudy, an intruder. Unlike the passive Eve, Mallory is an active attacker (often used in man-in-the-middle attacks), who can modify messages, substitute messages, or replay old messages. The difficulty of securing a system against a Mallory is much greater than against an Eve. |
| Michael or Mike                           | Used as an alternative to the eavesdropper Eve, from microphone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Niaj                                      | Used as an alternative to the eavesdropper Eve in several South Asian nations.[27]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Olivia                                    | An oracle, who responds to queries from other participants. Olivia often acts as a "black box" with some concealed state or information, or as a random oracle.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Oscar                                     | An opponent, similar to Mallory, but not necessarily malicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Peggy or Pat                              | A prover, who interacts with the verifier to show that the intended transaction has actually taken place. Peggy is often found in zero-knowledge proofs.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rupert                                    | A repudiator who appears for interactions that desire non-repudiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Sybil                                     | A pseudonymous attacker, who usually uses a large number of identities. For example, Sybil may attempt to subvert a reputation system. See Sybil attack.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Trent or Ted                              | A trusted arbitrator, who acts as a neutral third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Victor or Vanna                           | A verifier, who requires proof from the prover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Walter                                    | A warden, who may guard Alice and Bob.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Wendy                                     | A whistleblower, who is an insider with privileged access capable of divulging information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Arthur and Merlin                         | Merlin provides answers, and Arthur asks questions.[29] Merlin has unbounded computational ability (like the wizard Merlin). In interactive proof systems, Merlin claims the truth of a statement, and Arthur (like King Arthur), questions him to verify the claim.                                                        |
| Paul and Carole                           | Paul asks questions, and Carole provides answers. In the solution of the Twenty Questions problem,[30] Paul (standing in for Paul Erdős) asked questions and Carole (an anagram of "oracle") answered them. Paul and Carole were also used in combinatorial games, in the roles of pusher and chooser.[31]                  |
| Arthur and Bertha                         | Arthur is the "left", "black", or "vertical" player, and Bertha is the "right", "white", or "horizontal" player in a combinatorial game. Additionally, Arthur, given the same outcome, prefers a game to take the fewest moves, while Bertha prefers a game to take the most moves.[32]                                     |
